# Automated, reproducible, transparent, Windows builds for [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org/), [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli), [libssh2](https://libssh2.org/) and [OpenSSL 1.1](https://www.openssl.org/)

  - **SECURITY NOTICE: It is strongly recommended to upgrade to curl 7.65.1_2
    and OpenSSL 1.1.1c_2, released on 2019-06-20, or newer. Previous releases
    were discovered to have a code injection (and potential privilege
    escalation) vulnerability triggered via OpenSSL's build configuration
    defaults when using certain Windows compilers, including MinGW. The issue
    has been fixed by applying a local OpenSSL patch along with the required
    build configuration change.
    <br>Further information:
    [CVE-2019-5443](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-5443.html)**
  - Packaging aims to follow popular binary releases found on the internet.
  - Both x64 and x86 packages are built using the same process.
  - Binary packages are downloadable in `.zip` and `.tar.xz` formats.<br>
    `.xz` files and the resulting `.tar` archive can also be extracted using
    [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) on Windows.
  - Standalone `curl.exe` (only
    [`msvcrt.dll`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files#MSVCRT.DLL,_MSVCP*.DLL_and_CRTDLL.DLL)
    is
    [required](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=1273)).
  - curl/libcurl are built with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)
    support enabled.
  - curl/libcurl features enabled by default:
    <br>`dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp`
    <br>`AsynchDNS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile MultiSSL NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI TLS-SRP UnixSockets brotli libz`
  - The build process is fully transparent by using publicly available
    open source code, C compiler, build scripts and running the build
    [in public](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/master),
    with open, auditable [build logs](#live-build-logs).
  - C compiler toolchain is latest MinGW-w64 (non-multilib, x64 and x86)
    either via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS),
    [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Debian)) (on Debian via Docker)
    or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (on Windows).
    C compiler is [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or
    [LLVM/Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for projects supporting it.
  - Binaries are cross-built and published from Linux
    (via [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/)), using LLVM/Clang for
    curl, libssh2, nghttp2, c-ares, brotli, zstd and zlib, and GCC for OpenSSL.
    <br>Exact OS image used for the builds is
    [`debian:testing`](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/tree/dist-amd64/testing)
    (a [reproducible](https://github.com/debuerreotype/debuerreotype) image)
    via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/).
  - Binaries are built with supported
    [hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_%28computing%29)
    options enabled.
  - Binaries are using [DWARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF) in x86 and
    [SEH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft-specific_exception_handling_mechanisms#SEH)
    in x64 builds.
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes and also GPG signatures where
    available.
  - Generated binaries are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/),
    meaning they will have the same hash given the same input sources and C
    compiler.
  - Because the build environment is updated before each build, subsequent
    builds _may_ use different versions/builds of the compiler toolchain.
    This may result in different generated binaries given otherwise unchanged
    source code and configuration, sometimes thus breaking reproducibility.
    This trade-off was decided to be tolerable for more ideal binaries and
    allowing this project to automatically benefit from continuous C compiler
    updates.
  - Patching policy: No locally maintained patches. Patches are only
    applied locally if already merged upstream or &mdash; in case it's
    necessary for a successful build &mdash; had them submitted upstream
    with fair confidence of getting accepted.
  - curl/libcurl are built in MultiSSL mode, with both OpenSSL and
    [WinSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_Service_Provider)
    available as SSL backends.
  - Optional support for
    [C-ares](https://c-ares.haxx.se/).
  - Generated binaries are uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
  - If you need a download with a stable checksum, link to the penultimate
    version (or the revisioned binaries on the official download page).
    Only the current latest versions are kept updated with newer
    dependencies.
  - To verify the correct checksum for the latest build, you can look up the
    correct ones in the build log as they are generated. Watch for `master`
    branch job `Image: Ubuntu`, log lines starting with
    `SHA256(` or `SHA512(`:
      <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/master>
  - The build process is multi-platform and able to cross-build Windows
    executables from \*nix hosts (Linux and macOS tested.)
  - Packages created across different host platforms won't currently have
    identical hashes. The reason for this is the slightly different build
    options and versions of the `mingw-w64` and `binutils` tools.
  - Code signing is implemented and enabled with a self-signed certificate.
    The signature intentionally omits a trusted timestamp to retain
    reproducibility. Signing is done using a custom patched `osslsigncode`
    build to enforce a stable non-trusted timestamp for reproducibility.
